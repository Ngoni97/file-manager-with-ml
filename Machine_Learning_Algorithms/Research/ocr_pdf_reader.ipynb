On the one hand we have\\n_\\nthe work of analysts and geometers, in the way offormulating and systematising\\ntheir axioms, and the work of Cantor and others on such matters as the theory\\n.\\nof aggregates. On the other hand we have symbolic logic, which, after a\\nnecessary period of growth, has now, thanks to Peano and his followers,\\n‘acquired the technical adaptability and the logical comprehensiveness that are\\nessential to\\na mathematical instrument for dealing with what have hitherto\\nbeen the beginnings of mathematics.\\nFrom the combination of these two\\nstudies two results emerge, namely (1) that what were formerly taken, tacitly\\nor explicitly, as axioms, are either unnecessary or demonstrable; (2) that the\\nsame methods by which supposed axioms are demonstrated will give valuable\\nresults in regions, such as infinite number, which had formerly been regarded\\nas inaccessible to human knowledge.\\nHence the scope of mathematics is\\nenlarged both by the addition of new subjects and by a backward extension\\ninto provinces hitherto abandoned to philosophy.\\n|\\n.\\nThe present work was originally intended by us to be comprised in a\\nsecond volume of The Principles of Mathematics.\\nWith that object in view,\\nthe writing of it was begun in 1900.\\nBut as we advanced, it became in-\\ncreasingly evident that the subject is a very much larger one than we had\\n|\\nsupposed; moreover on many fundamental questions which had been left\\nobscure and doubtful in the former work, we have now arrived at what we\\nbelieve to be satisfactory solutions.\\nIt therefore became necessary to make\\nour book independent of The Principles of Mathematics. We have, however,\\navoided both controversy and general philosophy, and made our statements\\ndogmatic in form. The justification for this is that the chief reason in favour\\nof any theory on the principles of mathematics must always be inductive,\\ni.e. it must lie in the fact that the theory in question enables us to deduce\\n—\\nordinary mathematics.\\nIn mathematics, the greatest degree of self-evidence\\nis usually not t6 be found quite at the beginning, but at some later point,\\nhence the early deductions, until they reach this point, give reasons rather’\\nfor believing the premisses because true consequences follow from them, than\\nfor believing the consequences because they follow from the premisses.\\nIn constructing a deductive system such as that contained in the present\\nwork, there are two opposite tasks which have to be concurrently performed.\\nOn the one hand, we have to analyse existing mathematics, with a view\\nto discovering what premisses are employed, whether these premisses are\\nmutually consistent, and whether they are capable of reduction to more\\nfundamental premisses.\\nOn the other hand, when we have decided upon our\\npremisses, we have to build up again as much as may seem necessary of the\\ndata previously analysed, and as many other consequences of our premisses\\nas are of sufficient general interest to deserve statement. The preliminary\\n.\\nlabour of analysis does not appear in the final presentation, which merely\\nsets forth the outcome of the analysis in certain undefined ideas and\\n|\\n|\\nvi\\nPREFACE\\n7\\n-\\nundemonstrated propositions.\\nIt is not claimed that the analysis could not\\nhave been carried farther: we have no reason to suppose that it is impossible\\nto find simpler ideas and axioms by means of which those with which we\\nstart could be defined and demonstrated.\\nAll that is affirmed is that the\\nideas and axioms with which we start are\\nsufficient, not that they are\\nnecessary.\\n.\\n_\\nIn making deductions from our premisses, we have considered it essential\\nto carry them up to the point where we have proved as much as is true in\\nwhatever would ordinarilybe taken for granted. But we have not -thought\\nit desirable to limit ourselves too strictly to this task.\\nIt is customary to\\nconsider only particular cases, even when, with our apparatus, it is just as\\neasy to deal with the general case.\\nFor example, cardinal arithmetic is\\nusually conceived in connection with finite numbers, but its general laws hold\\nequally for infinite numbers, and are most easily proved without any mention\\nof the distinction between finite and infinite.\\nAgain, many of the properties\\ncommonly associated with series hold of arrangements which are not strictly\\nserial, but have only some of the distinguishing properties of serial arrange-\\nments. In such cases, it is a defect in logical style to prove for a particular\\nclass ofarrangements what might just as well have been proved more generally.\\nAn analogous process of generalization is involved, to a greater or less degree,\\nin all our werk. We have sought always the most general reasonably simple\\n:\\nhypothesis from which any given conclusion could be reached. For this reason,\\nespecially in the later parts of the book, the importance of a proposition\\nusually lies in its hypothesis.\\nThe conclusion will often be something which,\\nin a certain class of cases, is familiar, but the hypothesis will, whenever possible,\\nbe wide enough to admit many cases besides those in which the conclusion is\\nfamiliar.\\n.\\nWe have found it necessary to give very full proofs, because otherwise it\\nis scarcely possible to see what hypotheses are really required, or whether our\\nresults follow from our explicit premisses.\\n(It must be remembered that we\\nare not affirming merely that such and such propositions are true, but also\\n|\\nthat the axioms stated by us are sufficient to prove them.) At the same time,\\nthough full proofs are necessary for the avoidance of errors, and for convincing\\n.\\nthose who may feel doubtful as to our correctness, yet the proofs of propo-\\nsitions may usually be omitted by a reader who is not specially interested in\\nthat part of the subject concerned, and who feels no doubt of our substantial\\naccuracy on the matter in hand.\\nThe reader who is specially interested in\\nsome particular portion of the book will probably find it sufficient, as regards\\nearlier portions, to read the summaries of previous parts,\\nsections, and\\nnumbers, since these give explanations of the ideas involved and statements of\\nthe principal propositions proved.\\nThe proofs in Part I, Section A, however,\\nare necessary, since in the course of them the manner of stating proofs is\\nexplained.\\nThe proofs of the earliest propositions are given without the\\nomission of any step, but as the work proceeds the proofs are gradually\\ncompressed, retaining however sufficient detail to enable the reader by the\\nhelp of the references to reconstruct proofs in which no step is omitted.\\nThe order adopted is to some extent optional. For example, we have treated\\ncardinal arithmetic and relation-arithmetic before series, but we might have\\ntreated series first.\\nTo a great extent, however, the order is determined by\\nlogical necessities.\\n.\\nPREFACE\\nvii\\nA very large part of the labour involved in writing the present work has\\n'\\nbeen expended on the contradictions and paradoxes which have infected logic\\nand the theory of aggregates.\\nWe have examined a great number of hypo-\\ntheses for dealing with these contradictions; many such hypotheses have been\\n-\\n.advanced by others, and about as many have been invented by ourselves.\\nSometimes it. has cost us several months’ work to convince ourselves that\\na hypothesis was untenable.\\nIn the course of such a prolonged study, we\\nhave been led, as was to be expected, to modify our views from time to time;\\nbut it gradually became evident to us that some form of the doctrine of types\\nmust be adopted if the contradictions were to be avoided.\\nThe particular\\nform of the doctrine of types advocated in the present work is not logically\\nindispensable, and there are various other forms equally compatible with the\\ntruth of our deductions. We have particularized, both because the form of\\nthe doctrine which we advocate appears to us the most probable, and because\\nit was necessary to give at least one perfectly definite theory which avoids.\\n'\\nthe contradictions. But hardly anything in our book would be changed by the\\nadoption of a different form of the doctrine of types.\\nIn fact, we may go\\n_ farther, and say that, supposing some other way of avoiding the contradictions\\nto exist, not very much of our book, except what explicitly deals with types,\\nis dependent upon the adoption of the doctrine of types in any form, so soon\\nas it has been shown (as we claim that we have shown) that it is possible\\nto construct a mathematical logic which does not lead to contradictions.\\nIt\\nshould be observed that the whole effect of the doctrine of types is negative:\\n.\\nit forbids certain inferences which would otherwise be valid, but does not\\npermit any which would otherwise be invalid.\\nHence we may reasonably\\n.expect that the inferences which the doctrine of types permits would remain\\n—\\nvalid even if the doctrine should be found to be invalid.\\nOur logical system is wholly contained in the numbered propositions, which\\nare independent of the Introduction and the Summaries.\\nThe Introduction\\n_and the Summaries are wholly explanatory, and form no part of the chain of\\ndeductions.\\nThe explanation of the hierarchy of types in the Introduction\\ndiffers slightly from that given in *12 of the body of the work.\\nThe latter\\nexplanation isstricter and is that which is assumed throughout the rest of\\nthe book.\\nThe symbolic form of the work has been forced upon us by necessity:\\nwithout\\nits help we should have been unable to perform the requisite\\nreasoning.\\nIt has been developed as the result of actual practice, and is not\\nan excrescence introduced for the mere purpose of exposition.\\nThe general\\nmethod which guides our handling of logical symbols is‘due to Peano.\\nHis\\ngreat merit consists not so much inhis definite logical discoveries nor in the\\ndetails of his notations (excellent as both are), as in the fact that he first\\nshowed how symbolic logic was to be freed from its undue obsession with the\\nforms of ordinary algebra, and thereby made it a suitable instrument for\\nresearch.\\nGuided by our study of his methods, we have used great freedom\\nin constructing, or reconstructing, a symbolism which shall be adequate to\\ndeal with all parts of the subject. No symbol has been introduced except\\non the ground of its practical utility for the immediate purposes of our\\nreasoning.\\n|\\nA certain number of forward references will be found in the notes and\\nexplanations. Although we have taken every reasonable precaution to secure\\nVill\\nPREFACE\\nthe accuracy of these forward references, we cannot of course guarantee their\\naccuracy with the same confidence as is possible in the case of backward\\nreferences.\\n_ Detailed acknowledgments of obligations to previous writers have not very\\noften been possible, as we have had to transform whatever we have borrowed,\\nin order to adapt it to our system and our notation.\\nOur chief obligations\\nwill be obvious to every reader who is familiar with the literature of the\\nsubject. In the matter of notation, we have as far as possible followed Peano,\\nsupplementing his notation, when necessary, by that of Frege or by that of\\nSchréder. A great deal of the symbolism, however, has had to be new, not\\nso much through dissatisfaction with the symbolism of others,as through the\\nfact that we deal with ideas not previously symbolised.\\nIn all questionsof\\nlogical analysis, our chief debt is to Frege.\\nWhere we differ from him, it is\\nlargely because the contradictions showed that he, in common with all other\\nlogicians ancient and modern, had allowed some error to creep into his pre-\\nmisses; but apart from the contradictions, it would have been almost impossible\\nto detect this error.\\nIn Arithmetic and the theory of series, our whole work\\nis based on that of Georg Cantor.\\nIn Geometry we have had continually\\nbefore us the writings of v. Staudt, Pasch, Peano, Pieri, and Veblen.\\nWe have derived assistance at various stages from the criticisms of friends,\\nnotably Mr G. G. Berry of the Bodleian Library and Mr R. G. Hawtrey.\\nWe have to thank the Council of the Royal Society for a grant towards the\\nexpenses ofprinting of £200 from the Government Publication Fund, and also\\nthe Syndics of the University Press who have liberally undertaken the greater\\nportion of the expense incurred in the production of the work. The technical\\nexcellence, in all departments, ofthe University Press, and the zeal and courtesy\\nof its officials, have materially lightened the task of proof-correction.\\nThe second volume is already in the press, and both it and the third will\\nappear as soon as the printing\\ncan be completed.\\nA.

      "PREFACE\n",
      "What is applied mathematics? Every answer to this question is likely to\n",
      "initiate a debate. My definition is the use of mathematics to solve problems\n",
      "or gain insight into phenomena that arise outside of mathematics. The\n",
      "prototypical example is the use of mathematics to solve problems in physics.\n",
      "Of course, the world of applied mathematics is much broader: important\n",
      "applications of mathematics occur in all areas of science, engineering, and\n",
      "technology.\n",
      "The concept of this book is to introduce the reader to one aspect of\n",
      "applied mathematics: the use of differential equations to solve physical\n",
      "problems. To cover the full (ever expanding) range of applications of\n",
      "mathematics would require a series of books, which would include invi-\n",
      "tations to applied mathematics using the other branches of mathematics:\n",
      "calculus, linear algebra, differential geometry, graph theory, combinatorics,\n",
      "number theory, the calculus of variations, probability theory, and others. The\n",
      "application of statistics (especially in experimental science) is a branch of\n",
      "applied mathematics of great importance, but of a different character than\n",
      "the applied mathematics considered here.\n",
      "Although there are already many books and articles devoted to appli-\n",
      "cations of mathematical subjects, I believe that there is room for more\n",
      "introductory material accessible to advanced undergraduates and beginning\n",
      "graduate students. If my invitation is accepted, perhaps the reader will\n",
      "pursue further study, find a problem in applied mathematics, and make a\n",
      "contribution to technology or the understanding of the physical universe.\n",
      "My invitation includes a tour through a few of the historically important\n",
      "uses of differential equations in science and technology. The relevant\n",
      "mathematics is presented in context where there is no question of its\n",
      "importance.\n",
      "A typical scenario in many research papers by mathematicians is an\n",
      "introduction that includes such phrases as “our subject is important in the\n",

      "they give a mathematical example to illustrate their result, but all too often,\n",
      "their theorem does not solve a problem of interest in the scientific area that\n",
      "they used to advertise their work. This is not applied mathematics. The\n",
      "correct approach is joint work with an expert in some area of science: a\n",
      "physical problem is stated, a mathematical model is proposed, a prediction\n",
      "is made from the mathematical model—a step that might require some new\n",
      "mathematics including mathematical theorems—and the prediction is tested\n",
      "against a physical experiment. This point of view motivates the style of the\n",
      "presentation in all that follows.\n",
      "Although the basics of mathematical modeling is discussed, the models\n",
      "to be considered arise from problems where the underlying science is easily\n",
      "accessible. The simple truth is that the construction of many important\n",
      "mathematical models requires a serious treatment of the corresponding\n",
      "science. This is one good reason for joint work between mathematicians\n",
      "and scientists or engineers on applied projects. Carefully chosen models,\n",

      "Applied mathematics requires an understanding of mathematics, some\n",
      "familiarity with the subject area of application, creativity, hard work, and\n",

      "applied mathematician approaching this book, you should know at least\n",
      "what constitutes a mathematical proof and have a working knowledge of\n",
      "basic analysis and linear algebra. To proceed further toward competence\n",
      "in applied mathematics, you will need to know and understand more and\n",

      "matical modeling. The prerequisites for students are vector calculus, basic\n",
      "differential equations, the rudiments of matrix algebra, knowledge of some\n",
      "programming language, and of course some mathematical maturity. No\n",
      "knowledge of partial differential equations or numerical analysis is assumed.\n",
      "The author has used parts of this book while teaching courses in\n",
      "mathematical modeling at the University of Missouri where students (un-\n",
      "dergraduate and graduate) of engineering, the sciences, and mathematics\n",
      "enrolled. This heterogeneous mix of students should be expected in a course\n",
      "at the advanced undergraduate beginning graduate level with a title such\n",
      "as Mathematical Modeling I. Thus, the instructor must assess the abilities\n",
      "and background knowledge of the students who show up on the first day\n",
      "of class. Professors should be prepared and willing to modify their syllabus\n",
      "after a week or two of instruction to accommodate their students. In fact, the\n",
      "most likely modification is to cover less material at a slower pace. Perhaps\n",
      "learning a few concepts and techniques well is always more valuable than\n",
      "exposure to a survey of new ideas.\n",
      "A typical 15-week semester course might consist of one lecture on\n",
      "Chapter 1, two weeks on Chapter 2 (mostly ODE), two weeks on Chapter\n",
      "5 (fundamental physical modeling, reaction-diffusion systems, and basic\n",
      "numerics for simple parabolic PDE), one week on Chapter 6 (electrical\n",
      "signals on neurons and traveling wave solutions), and one week on Chapter 8\n",
      "(basic PID control) to complete approximately half of the semester. Of\n",
      "course only parts of the material in these chapters (in particular Chapter 5)\n",
      "can be covered in detail in class. By this time in the semester at least three\n",
      "substantial homework assignments should be completed using exercises,\n",
      "problems, and projects suggested in the text. Of course, there is good reason\n",
      "to also include exercises designed by the instructor. At least, students should\n",

       " 6: \"PREFACE\\nvii\\nA very large part of the labour involved in writing the present work has\\n’\\n‘been expended on the contradictions and paradoxes which have infected logic\\nand the theory of aggregates.\\nWe have examined a great number of hypo-\\ntheses for dealing with these contradictions;many such hypotheses have been\\n. advanced by others, and about as many have been invented by ourselves.\\nSometimes it-has cost us several months’ work to convince ourselves that\\na hypothesis was untenable.\\nIn the course of such a prolonged study, we\\nhave been led, as was to be expected, to modify our views from time to time;\\nbut it gradually became evident to us that some form of the doctrine of types\\nmust be adopted if the contradictions were to be avoided.\\nThe particular\\nform of the doctrine of types advocated in the present work is not logically\\nindispensable, and there are various other forms equally compatible with the\\ntruth of our deductions. We have particularized, both because the form of\\nthe doctrine which we advocate appears to us the most probable, and because\\nit was necessary to give at least one perfectly definite theory which avoids\\n’\\nthe contradictions. But hardly anything in our book would be changed by the\\nadoption of a different form of the doctrine of types.\\nIn fact, we may go\\n_ farther, and say that, supposing some other way of avoiding the contradictions\\nto exist, not very much of our book, except what explicitly deals with types,\\nis dependent upon the adoption of the doctrine of types in any form, so soon\\nas it has been shown (as we claim that we have shown) that it is possible\\nto construct a mathematical logic which does not lead to contradictions.\\nIt\\nshould be observed that the whole effect of the doctrine of types is negative:\\n.\\nit forbids certain inferences which would otherwise be valid, but does not\\npermit any which would otherwise be invalid.\\nHence we may reasonably\\n.expect that the inferences which the doctrine of types permits would remain\\nvalid even if the doctrine should be found to be invalid.\\nOur logical system is wholly contained in the numbered propositions, which\\nare independent of the Introduction and the Summaries.\\nThe Introduction\\n.and the Summaries are wholly explanatory, and form no part of the chain of\\ndeductions.\\nThe explanation of the hierarchy of types in the Introduction\\ndiffers slightly from that given in *12 of the body of the work.\\nThe latter\\nexplanation is'stricter and is that which is assumed throughout the rest of\\nthe book.\\nThe symbolic form of the work has been forced upon us by necessity:\\nwithout\\nits help we should have been unable to perform the requisite\\nreasoning.\\nIt has been developed as the result of actual practice, and is not\\nan excrescence introduced for the mere purpose of exposition.\\nThe general\\nmethod which guides our handling of logical symbols is‘due to Peano.\\nHis\\ngreat merit consists not so much in his definite logical discoveries nor in the\\ndetails of his notations (excellent as both are), as in the fact that he first\\nshowed how symbolic logic was to be freed from its undue obsession with the\\nforms of ordinary algebra, and thereby made it a suitable instrument for\\nresearch.\\nGuided by our study of his methods, we have used great freedom\\nin constructing, or reconstructing, a symbolism which shall be adequate to\\ndeal with all parts of the subject. No symbol has been introduced except\\non the ground of its practical utility for the immediate purposes of our\\nreasoning.\\nA certain number of forward references will be found in the notes and\\nexplanations.\\nAlthough we have taken every reasonable precaution to secure\\n\",\n",

We have particularized, both because the form of\\nthe doctrine which we advocate appears to us the most probable, and because\\nit was necessary to give at least one perfectly definite theory which avoids\\n’\\nthe contradictions. But hardly anything in our book would be changed by the\\nadoption of a different form of the doctrine of types.\\nIn fact, we may go\\n_ farther, and say that, supposing some other way of avoiding the contradictions\\nto exist, not very much of our book, except what explicitly deals with types,\\nis dependent upon the adoption of the doctrine of types in any form, so soon\\nas it has been shown (as we claim that we have shown) that it is possible\\nto construct a mathematical logic which does not lead to contradictions.\\nIt\\nshould be observed that the whole effect of the doctrine of types is negative:\\n.\\nit forbids certain inferences which would otherwise be valid, but does not\\npermit any which would otherwise be invalid.\\nHence we may reasonably\\n.expect that the inferences which the doctrine of types permits would remain\\nvalid even if the doctrine should be found to be invalid.\\nOur logical system is wholly contained in the numbered propositions, which\\nare independent of the Introduction and the Summaries.\\nThe Introduction\\n.and the Summaries are wholly explanatory, and form no part of the chain of\\ndeductions.\\nThe explanation of the hierarchy of types in the Introduction\\ndiffers slightly from that given in *12 of the body of the work.\\nThe latter\\nexplanation is'stricter and is that which is assumed throughout the rest of\\nthe book.\\nThe symbolic form of the work has been forced upon us by necessity:\\nwithout\\nits help we should have been unable to perform the requisite\\nreasoning.\\nIt has been developed as the result of actual practice, and is not\\nan excrescence introduced for the mere purpose of exposition.\\nThe general\\nmethod which guides our handling of logical symbols is‘due to Peano.\\nHis\\ngreat merit consists not so much in his definite logical discoveries nor in the\\ndetails of his notations (excellent as both are), as in the fact that he first\\nshowed how symbolic logic was to be freed from its undue obsession with the\\nforms of ordinary algebra, and thereby made it a suitable instrument for\\nresearch.\\nGuided by our study of his methods, we have used great freedom\\nin constructing, or reconstructing, a symbolism which shall be adequate to\\ndeal with all parts of the subject. No symbol has been introduced except\\non the ground of its practical utility for the immediate purposes of our\\nreasoning.\\nA certain number of forward references will be found in the notes and\\nexplanations.\\nAlthough we have taken every reasonable precaution to secure\\nCONTENTS OF VOLUME I\\nPAGE\\nPREFACE\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n:\\n.\\n.\\n:\\n-\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nv\\nALPHABETICAL LIST OF PROPOSITIONS REFERRED TO BY\\nNAMES\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n:\\n.\\n.\\n:\\nxii\\nINTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION.\\n.\\n.\\n:\\nxiii\\nINTRODUCTION\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n1\\nCuapTer I.\\nPreviminary Expianations or Ipeas anp NoTaTIOoNs.\\n.\\n4\\nCuaprer II, Tae Taory or Locican Types.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n:\\n37\\nCarter IIT.\\nIncompiere Sympots\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n-\\n-\\n.\\n66\\nPARTI.

We thus obtain a number of new general propositions\\n.\\ndifferent from those of Section A.\\n(2) We introduce in Section B the new primitive idea “(qa). 2,” te.\\nexistence-propositions, which do not occur in Section A, In virtue of the\\nabolition of the real variable, general propositions of the form “(p). fp” do\\noccur in Section A, but “(qp)-fp” does not occur.\\n(3) By means of definitions, we introduce in Section B general propositions\\nwhich are molecular constituents of other propositions; thus “(#).¢v.v.p” is\\nto mean “(a). fev p.”\\nIt is these three novelties which distinguish Section B from Section A.\\nOne point in regard to which improvement is obviously desirable is the\\naxiom of reducibility (*12°1°11). This axiom has a purely pragmatic justifica-\\ntion: it leads to the desired results, and to no_others.\\nBut clearly it is not\\nthe sort of axiom with which we can rest content. On this subject, however,\\nit cannot be said that. a satisfactory solution is as yet obtainable. Dr Leon\\nChwistek* took the heroic course of dispensing with the axiom without\\nadopting any substitute; from his work, it is clear that this course compels\\nus to sacrifice a great deal of ordinary mathematics. There is another course,\\nrecommended by Wittgenstein} for philosophical reasons. This is to assume\\nthat functions of propositions are always truth-functions, and that a function\\ncan only occur in a proposition through its values. There are difficulties in\\nthe way of this view, but perhaps they are not insurmountable}.\\nIt involves\\nthe consequence that all functions of functions are extensional. It requires us\\nto maintain that “A believes p” is not a function of p. How this is possible.\\nis shown in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (loc. cit. and pp. 19—21). We are\\nnot prepared to assert that this theory is certainly right, but it has seemed\\nworth while to work out its consequences in the following pages. It appears\\nthat everything in Vol. I remains true (though often new proofs are required);\\nthe theory of inductive cardinals and ordinals survives; but it seems that the\\ntheory of infinite Dedekindian and well-ordered series largely collapses, so\\nthat irrationals, and real numbers generally, can no longer be adequately\\ndealt with.\\nAlso Cantor’s proof that 2” > breaks down unless n is finite.\\nPerhaps some further axiom, less objectionable than the axiom of reducibility,\\nmight give these results, but we have not succeeded in finding such an axiom.\\n* In his “‘ Theory of Constructive Types.”\\nSee references st the end of this Introduction.\\n+ Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, +5°54ff.\\nt See Appendix C.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nxv\\nIt should be stated that a new and very powerful method in mathematical\\nlogic has been invented by Dr H. M. Sheffer.\\nThis method, however, would\\ndemand a complete re-writing of Principia Mathematica. We recommend\\n.\\nthis task to Dr Sheffer, since what has so far been published by him is\\n:\\nscarcely sufficient to enable others to undertake the necessary reconstruction.\\nWe now proceed to the detailed development of the above general sketch.\\nI.\\nATOMIC AND MOLECULAR PROPOSITIONS\\nOur system begins with “atomic propositions.” We accept these as a\\ndatum, because the problems which arise concerning them belong to the\\nphilosophical part of logic, and are not amenable (at any rate at present) to\\nmathematical treatment.\\nAtomic propositions may be defined negatively as propositions containing\\nno parts that are propositions, and not containing the notions “all” or “some.”\\nThus “this is red,” “this is earlier than that,” are atomic propositions.\\nAtomic propositions may also be defined positively—and this is the better\\ncourse—as propositions of the following sorts:\\nR, («), meaning “« has the predicate R,”;\\nR,(«,y) [or «R,y], meaning “sx has the relation R, (in intension) to y”;\\nR; (a, y, 2), meaning “x,y,z have the triadic relation R, (in intension)”;\\nR, (2, y, Z,w), meaning “x,y,z,w have the tetradic relation R, (in intension)”;\\nand so on ad infinitum, or at any rate as‘long as possible.\\nLogic does not\\nknow whetherthere are in fact n-adic relations (in intension); this is anempirical\\nquestion. We know as an empirical fact that there are at least dyadic relations\\n(in intension), because without them series would be impossible.\\nBut logic is\\nnot interested in this fact; it is concerned solely with the hypothesis of there\\nbeing propositions of such-and-such a form. In certain cases, this hypothesis is\\nitself of the form in question, or contains a part which is of the form in question;\\nin these cases, the fact that the hypothesis can be framed proves that it is\\ntrue.\\nBut even when a hypothesis occurs in logic, the fact that it can be\\nframed does not itself belong to logic.\\nGiven all true atomic propositions, together with the fact that they are all,\\nevery other true proposition can theoretically be deduced by logical methods.\\nThat is to- say, the apparatus of crude fact required in proofs can all be con-\\ndensed into the true atomic propositions together with the fact that every\\ntrue atomic proposition is one of the following: (here the list should follow).\\nIfused, this method would presumably involve au infinite enumeration,\\nsince it seems natural to suppose that the number of true atomic propositions\\nis infinite, though this should not be regarded as certain.\\nIn practice,\\ngenerality is not obtained by the method of complete enumeration, because\\nthis method requires more knowledge than we possess.\\nR&WI\\n6\\nXVili\\nINTRODUCTION\\ntruth or falsehood can only be known empirically. But the truth of molecular\\npropositions of suitable form can be known universally without empirical\\nevidence.\\nThe laws of logic, so far as elementary propositions are concerned, are all\\nassertions to the effect that, whatever elementary propositions p, q, 7, ... may\\nbe, a certain function\\nFE (p,q 7 +++)\\nwhose values are molecular propositions, built up by means of the stroke, is\\nalways true. The proposition “\\n#'(p) is true, whatever elementary proposition\\np may be”\\nis denoted by\\n.\\n(p) -\\nF(p).\\nSimilarly the proposition “F'(p,q,r,...) is true, whatever eleméntary pro-\\npositions p, g, r,... may be” is denoted by\\n(PGT, ++)»\\nF (p,q 7, +.)\\nWhen such a proposition is asserted,\\nwe shall omit the “(p,g,7, ...)” at the\\nbeginning. Thus\\n“bh. Fp, 9,7, +2)”\\ndenotes the assertion (as opposed to the hypothesis) that F'(p,g,7,...) is true\\nwhatever elementary propositions p, g, 7, ... may be.\\n:\\n(The distinction between real and apparent variables, which occurs in\\nFrege and in Principia Mathematica, is unnecessary. Whatever appears as a\\nreal variable in Principia Mathematica is to be taken as an apparent variable\\nwhose scope is the whole of the asserted proposition in which it occurs.)\\nThe rule of inference, in the form given above, is never required within\\nlogic, but only when logic is applied. Within logic, the rule required is different.\\nIn the logic of propositions, which is what concerns us at present, the rule\\nused is:\\nGiven, whatever elementary propositions p, g,\\nr may be, both\\n“b.F(p,g,7,...)” and “Fk. F(p,q,7, -..) |{4(p,9¢,7,...)|\\n1 (p, 9.7, --)f,”\\nwe can infer “+. H(p,q,7, ...).”\\nOther forms of the rule of inference will meet us later.\\nFor the present,\\nthe above is the form we shall use.\\nNicod has shown that the logic of propositions («1—*5) can be deduced,\\nby the help of the rule of inference, from two primitive propositions\\n+. pl(p |p)\\nand\\nki:pIq-I-s|qIp|s.\\nThe first of these may be interpreted as “p is incompatible with not-p,” or\\nas “p or not-p,” or as “not (p and not-p),” or as “p implies p.” The second\\nmay be interpreted as\\nprgq-I:iqIvs.Dd.pIvs,\\nINTRODUCTION\\nxix\\nwhich is a form of the principle of the syllogism. Written wholly in terms of\\nthe stroke, the principle becomes\\n{p (al) Is|9) Cel s)1(pls))}1 (19) | Cel s)| Ce | 8))}.\\nNicod has shown further that these two principles may be replaced by\\n,\\none. Written wholly in terms of the stroke, this one principle is\\n(pl (alr) [fl 14}\\n| {19|(els)|(p|s))}}\\nIt will be seen that, written in this form, the principle is less complex than\\nthe second of the above principles written wholly in terms of the stroke.\\nWhen interpreted into the language of implication, Nicod’s one principle\\nbecomes\\npDd.g-rid.tIt.s|qrp|s.\\nIn this form, it looks more complex than\\nprq-2-s\\\\qI\\npls,\\nbut in itself it is less complex.\\nFrom the above primitive proposition, together with the rule of inference,\\neverything that logic can ascertain about elementary propositions can be\\nproved, provided we add one other primitive proposition, viz. that, given a\\nproposition (p,q, 7,..-)-F (p,q,\\n---), we may substitute\\nfor p,q,7, ..-\\nfunctions of the form\\nA (p, gq”, ve) Sa(p, GY vee) Sts(p, ZT, 9)\\nand assert\\n(1.07% =) FLAG\\nds Fa G0 f(D GM dy veh\\nwhere fi, fo, fs,--- are functions constructed by means of the stroke. Since\\nthe former assertion applied to all elementary propositions, while the latter\\napplies only to some, it is obvious that the former implies the latter.\\nA more general form of this principle will concern us later.\\nII. ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS OF INDIVIDUALS\\n1.\\nDefinition of “individual”\\nWe saw that atomic propositions are of one of the series of forms:\\nR,(«), R(#,y), Bs(a,y,2), Ri(2y, 2), +--+\\nHere R,, R,, R;, Ry, ... are each characteristic of the special form in which\\nthey are found: that is to say, R, cannot occur in an atomic proposition\\nRy (@, a, -.» 2m) unless n =m, and then can only occur as KR» occurs, not as\\n2,, L, +... Lm occur.\\nOn the other hand, any term which can occur as the\\na's occur in Ry (a, 4, -.. Za) can also occur as one of the a’s in Ry (a, #2, ++. Zm)\\neven if m is not equal to n.\\nTerms which can occur in any form of atomic\\nproposition are called “ individuals” or “ particulars”; terms which occur as the\\nR’s occur are called “ universals.”\\n_\\nWe might state our definition compendiously as follows: An “individual”\\nig anything that can be the subject of an atomic proposition.\\n\""
